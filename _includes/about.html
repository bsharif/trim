                                    <p class="text-muted">TRiM is a proactive, peer delivered, cognitively based human resource management initiative for supporting individuals following exposure to traumatic events.  Its purpose is the early identification of the symptoms of stress. TRiM is not a treatment for stress however processing and talking about the event has therapeutic advantage.

                                    <p class="text-muted">Looking after your staff after traumatic incidents is both morally justified and, after work-related traumatic incidents, legally necessary. Additionally, it makes sound economic sense to avoid the loss of valuable personnel to the effects of psychological trauma. There is ample evidence that people exposed to work related stress are likely to be less effective at work, more likely to be absent from work and to suffer poor mental health. For instance, a 2007 report noted that impaired work efficiency, as a result of mental disorders, costs the UK £15.1 billion a year, with mental-health-related absenteeism costing an additional £8.4 billion annually.

                                    <p class="text-muted">TRiM began within the UK’s Royal Marines Commandos.  However, many other non-military organisations now use TRiM including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office; media organisations including the BBC and the emergency services including the London Ambulance Service and numerous UK police forces; and private organisations. 
 
                                    TRiM has been successfully employed by various organisations after a number of incidents, including September 11th 2001, the Bali Bombings, the London Bombings as well as numerous more ‘routine’ traumatic incidents, such as vehicle accidents and assaults.
