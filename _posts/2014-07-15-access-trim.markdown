### TRiM Awareness 1 Day Course

This 1 day course is a stand alone an introduction to Trauma Risk Management and how to apply its key tenets in your working environment.

### TRiM Practitioner 2 Day Course

This 2 day TRiM Practitioner course provides someone with no specialist medical or psychological knowledge with the knowledge and skills to become a TRiM Practitioner. It can be a stand alone course, or could be designed to lead on from the TriM Awarenss 1 Day Course with an additional day’s training for nominated staff.  TRiM Practitioners can then work to look after small groups of staff who may be at risk of developing psychological distress after traumatic events.
